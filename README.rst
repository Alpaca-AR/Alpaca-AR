========
Alpaca 2
========

This project contains the entirety of the code/executable side of the
second attempt at the Alpaca project. Currently it is made of two parts:
the Alpaca Server and the Alpaca Extension.


Running
-------

To run the project, use the included Makefile::

  $ make run

This will build a Docker container and then run the application inside
of it. To run on a different port or with a different tag, run::

  $ make run PORT=8888
  $ make run TAG=alpaca_foo
  $ make run PORT=8888 TAG=alpaca_foo


Usage
-----

Using the Alpaca Server falls into two types of usage: the runtime server
and the object store. The runtime server serves html/js files that use
the object store. The object store is a simple RESTful persistant database
(essentially).

The runtime server is at `link <http://localhost:8080/>`_. The object
server is at `link <http://localhost:8080/store/>`_.

With the object server, you can:

``GET /store/``
  Retreive the list of namespaces in the store.

``GET /store/:namespace/``
  Retrieve the list of entries in the namespace.

``POST /store/:namespace/``
  Create a new object with an autogenerated name, using the POST body
  and Content-Type header.

``GET /store/:namespace/:name``
  Retrieve the previously created object.

``PUT /store/:namespace/:name``
  Update the given object.
